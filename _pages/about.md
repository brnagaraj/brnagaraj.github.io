Hi! I'm **Nagaraj BR,**

I'm employed as a Test Engineer in the PLINTRON Mobility Solutions for the past 1.5+ years, based in Chennai. I deal with Web application testing i.e Functional Testing, API Testing, User Interface Testing with Responsiveness, and Mobile App Testing.

I exhilarate to learn and update myself in the domain where I work.I decide to record all my gained and gaining knowledge in Software Testing on other hand to spread the same to others in simplest form as much as I can.
